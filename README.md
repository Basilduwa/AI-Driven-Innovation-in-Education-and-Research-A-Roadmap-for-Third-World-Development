# AI-Driven-Innovation-in-Education-and-Research-A-Roadmap-for-Third-World-Development
This study examines the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in addressing the structural issues in education in developing countries. We developed an integrated educational challenge score that focuses on out-of-school rates, completion rates, and proficiency levels, using a multi-indicator dataset from 124 countries. Our results for the developed composite score showed Niger, South Sudan, and Djibouti as the most affected third-world nations having the urgent need for educational upgrade. In the regression result, the Random Forest Regressor most accurately predicted unemployment based on education variables (RÂ² = 0.17), indicating a modest but relevant relationship between disparities in education and labor outcomes.
